# python-dictionary
This is a dictionary written in python language. The python script can be run through terminal where user have to enter a word and then it will display the results in the terminal itself.
The best part of the dictionary is that even if the user enters the word which is a combination of uppercase and lowercase like 'rAIn' it will automatically detects the word and will display the results.
Another interesting feature of this dictionary is that when user enters a wrong word which may be the result of typing error, then it will automatically generates the most closest/similar word 
and ask the user if he/she is searching for that word. This dictionary uses json data file which contains all the words and their definitions. data.json file is required to run the python script properly.
